    "- It uses the following mechanisms to produce a user representation:\n",
    "  - **Multi-head additive attention** (`MultiHeadAdditiveAttention`): Aggregates information from multiple interaction embeddings.\n",
    "  - **Additive attention** (`UserAdditiveAttention`): Focuses on the most relevant interactions to refine the user representation.\n",
